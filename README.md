# NY Citibike

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to see if the bike rental business is worth investing into for other cities. One factor to look at is the trip duration of a bike ride. Given this system is already implemented in New York, data has already been provided for the bicycle rental system. Choosing data within a period during the summer would be ideal as physical activity is encouraged. Data from August 2019 was taken to see bike activity from that month. One change from the initial data has to be changed, so that the trip duration can be recorded from seconds to hours, seconds, and minutes. This was done through Python. Afterwards, the updated column will be used for the data visualization, using Tableau.

## Results

7 visualizations were made to represent the bike activity for August 2019. Here were the results:

* There were a total 2,344,224 bike rides done in August 2019.
* Within those total trips, 1,900,359 of those trips were from subscribers of the company, while 443,865 of them were from customers.
* Majority of the bike rides within August lasted around 3-11 minutes.
* The number of bike rides from August were from predominantly male users. Women don't have as large of a peak for the trip duration, while users who don't have their gender listed don't have much of a peak for said trip duration.
* The most popular time period to ride a bike in August appears to be on Thursdays from 5PM-7PM.
* All visualizations can be found from [this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.viernes/viz/NYCitibike_16230073061550/NYCitibike)

## Summary

From the data visualizations, it seems that within August 2019, Thursday is the most popular day to ride a bike. This would be the case, regardless of gender or user type. It would be adviseable for the customer to recommend this business to another city, because within the summer, people are more likely to be physically active. One data visualization that could be recommended would be distance travelled within the trip. This is mainly because everyone wouldn't necessarily be riding at the same speed. Another data visualization that could be recommended would be the number of users based on age. This is to list the more common age range of users, which could potentially lead to advertising for said age range when starting the business in a different city.
